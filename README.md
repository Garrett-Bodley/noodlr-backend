# Noodlr - Backend

Rails API backend

## Getting Started

To run locally first run `bundle install`. You will need to set to declare a `JWT_SECRET` variable inside of a `.env` file. I recommend using SecureRandom to generate your secret. After that `rails db:migrate` and you should be all set to start the server.
